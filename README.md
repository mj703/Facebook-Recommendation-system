<h1>Facebook Friend Recommendation</h1>

<p>This project aims to evaluate the most important and least important features for Facebook friend recommendation by using different distance techniques such as Jaccard distance, rank indexing, and Adar indexing. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>In order to improve the accuracy of the recommendation system, various artificial features were created using SVD factorization technique and detailed feature engineering. Random Forest and XGBoost models were used to evaluate the performance of the system.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>After conducting the experiments, it was concluded that "follow back" is the most important feature for recommending friends to people on Facebook.</p>

<h2>How to Run the Code</h2>

<p>To run the code, you will need to install the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. Then, simply run the main script, "facebook_friend_recommendation.py".</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/FacebookRecruiting">https://www.kaggle.com/c/FacebookRecruiting</a>. It includes data about Facebook users and their friends.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
